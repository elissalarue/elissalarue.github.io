        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I have always had a drive to better myself at topics I find interesting. I was first introduced to programming through a company-funded software engineering apprenticeship This included a 2-week intro course to programming to apply. Although I did not make the final cut for this, after completing the intro course, it instilled a fire to see this through and get a degree in Software Development.</p>
