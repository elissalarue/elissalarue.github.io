        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have always had a drive to better myself at topics I find interesting. I was first introduced to programming through a company-funded software engineering apprenticeship This included a 2-week intro course to programming to apply. Although I did not make the final cut for this, after completing the intro course, it instilled a fire to see this through and get a degree in Software Development.</p>
        <p>With completion of my <span style="color:brown">Intermediate Technical Certificate</span> I can move forward to be a software developer in the airline industry for which I currently am apart of. With plans to later go towards my full Associate Degree in the future. </p>
